;;; Commentary:
;; NOV == Yet Another EPub Reader 
;; Package nov.el is an alternative to Emacsvox's built-in EPub
;; reader.
;; This module speech-enables nov.el
;; In addition, opening an epub using nov results in
;; directory-specific settings being loaded from file
;; @var{emacsvox-speak-directory-settings} ---
;;  That file can set book-specific settings such as speech-rate and
;; punctuation-mode among others.

;;; Code:

;;   Required modules:

(eval-when-compile (require 'cl-lib))
(cl-declaim  (optimize  (safety 0) (speed 3)))
(require 'emacsvox-preamble)

;;;  Interactive Commands:

(defun ems--nov-browse-url-after (&rest _)
  "speak."
  (when (ems-interactive-p)
       (emacsvox-icon 'open-object)
       (emacsvox-speak-buffer)))

(cl-loop
 for f in
 '(nov-browse-url nov-display-metadata nov-goto-toc nov-next-document nov-previous-document)
 do
 (advice-add f :after #'ems--nov-browse-url-after))

(defun ems--nov-scroll-up-after (&rest _)
  "Speak the next screenful."
  (when (ems-interactive-p)
       (emacsvox-icon 'scroll)
       (dtk-speak (emacsvox-get-window-contents))))

(cl-loop
 for f in
 '(nov-scroll-up nov-scroll-down)
 do
 (advice-add f :after #'ems--nov-scroll-up-after))

;;; Mode Hook:

(defun emacsvox-nov-mode-hook ()
  "Load directory-specific speech settings."
  
  (emacsvox-speak-load-directory-settings default-directory))

(add-hook 'nov-mode-hook #'emacsvox-nov-mode-hook)

(provide 'emacsvox-nov)
