;;; Commentary:

;; This module defines the advice forms for making the core of Emacs speak
;; Advice forms that are specific to Emacs subsystems do not belong here!
;; I violate this at present by advising completion.
;; Note that we needed to advice a lot more for Emacs 19 and
;; Emacs 20 than we do for Emacs 21 and Emacs 22.
;; As of August 2007, this file is being purged of advice forms
;; not needed in Emacs 22.
