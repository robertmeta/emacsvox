;;; Commentary:
;; Which-Key displays available keybindings in a popup after pressing
;; a prefix key. This module speech-enables Which-Key to provide auditory
;; feedback for available bindings, supporting navigation through pages
;; and speaking the current binding options.

;;; Code:

;;   Required modules:

(eval-when-compile (require 'cl-lib))
(require 'emacsvox-preamble)
(require 'which-key nil 'noerror)

;;;  Silence byte-compiler about special variables:

(defvar which-key--buffer)
(defvar which-key--pages-obj)
(defvar which-key-init-buffer-hook)

;;;  Forward declarations:

(declare-function which-key--pages-height "which-key")
(declare-function which-key--pages-widths "which-key")
(declare-function which-key--popup-showing-p "which-key")
(declare-function which-key--current-key-string "which-key")

;;;  Map faces to voices:

(voice-setup-add-map
 '((which-key-key-face voice-bolden)
   (which-key-separator-face voice-smoothen)
   (which-key-note-face voice-annotate)
   (which-key-command-description-face voice-monotone)
   (which-key-local-map-description-face voice-brighten)
   (which-key-highlighted-command-face voice-animate)
   (which-key-group-description-face voice-bolden-medium)
   (which-key-special-key-face voice-lighten)
   (which-key-docstring-face voice-annotate)))
